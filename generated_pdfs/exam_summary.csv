"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 1","A simple pin-jointed truss is loaded with a vertical force of 1000 N at joint C. Using the method of joints, determine the internal forces in members AC, BC, and CD. Indicate whether the forces are tensile or compressive.",,
"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 2","For the truss shown, with support A pinned and support E on a roller, calculate the support reactions at A and E. The truss carries a uniform vertical load on joint C. Assume all members are weightless.",,
"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 3","Using the method of sections, determine the forces in members EF, DF, and DE of the loaded truss. A vertical load of 1200 N is applied at joint F. Clearly show your section and assumptions.",,
"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 4","A Pratt truss is subjected to vertical loads at the top and bottom chords. Explain how zero-force members are identified in a truss structure and identify all zero-force members in the given configuration.",,
"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 5","Given a Warren truss with a span of 6 m and equal panel lengths, determine the maximum force in any member when a point load of 1500 N is applied at the center-top joint. Use symmetry in your analysis.",,
"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"Question 6","Design an appropriate cross-section for a truss member experiencing a compressive force of 18 kN. The material is structural steel with a yield strength of 250 MPa, and a factor of safety of 1.5 is required. Show all calculations including buckling checks.",,
