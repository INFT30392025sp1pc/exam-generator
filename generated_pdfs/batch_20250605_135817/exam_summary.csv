"Alice Nguyen",alice.nguyen@example.com,"A simple pin-jointed truss is loaded with a vertical force of 1000 N at joint C. Using the method of joints, determine the internal forces in members AC, BC, and CD. Indicate whether the forces are tensile or compressive.","For the truss shown, with support A pinned and support E on a roller, calculate the support reactions at A and E. The truss carries a uniform vertical load on joint C. Assume all members are weightless.","Using the method of sections, determine the forces in members EF, DF, and DE of the loaded truss. A vertical load of 1200 N is applied at joint F. Clearly show your section and assumptions.","A Pratt truss is subjected to vertical loads at the top and bottom chords. Explain how zero-force members are identified in a truss structure and identify all zero-force members in the given configuration.","Given a Warren truss with a span of 6 m and equal panel lengths, determine the maximum force in any member when a point load of 1500 N is applied at the center-top joint. Use symmetry in your analysis.","Design an appropriate cross-section for a truss member experiencing a compressive force of 18 kN. The material is structural steel with a yield strength of 250 MPa, and a factor of safety of 1.5 is required. Show all calculations including buckling checks.",LoadAtJointC_N,1149,LoadAtJointF_N,1312,UniformLoadAtJointC_N,555,PointLoadAtTopCenterJoint_N,1114,TrussSpan_m,8,CompressiveForce_kN,11,YieldStrength_MPa,273,FactorOfSafety,1.82,A,19.02,B,13
