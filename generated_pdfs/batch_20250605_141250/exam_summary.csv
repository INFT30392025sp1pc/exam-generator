"Jamel Mann",jmann@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Calculate the axial force in member AB of the king post truss using the method of joints.","Determine the support reactions at points A and E for the given truss loaded at joints.","Using the method of sections, find the force in members CD, DE, and CE of the given roof truss.","Explain the difference between zero-force members and redundant members in a statically determinate truss.","A roof truss is subjected to a uniform distributed load of 5 kN/m. Determine the maximum tension and compression forces in any member."
